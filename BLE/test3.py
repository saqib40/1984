'''
Bluetooth LE device and service scanner.

Scan for Bluetooth LE devices in the area, and print details
about them and their services and characteristics.

Requires Bleak (Bluetooth LE Agnostic Klient)
    - https://github.com/hbldh/bleak
    - https://bleak.readthedocs.io/en/latest/

Output:
    - All devices found with names, addresses, RSSI, and metadata
    - All services from each device with UUIDs, handles, characteristics, etc.
